      Dynamic DNS (Domain Name System)
      is a service that allows users to assign a dynamic or changing IP address to a static hostname.
      This makes it possible to access a computer, server or other network device with a changing IP address through a domain name.
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, if you have a computer or a server with a dynamic IP address,
      you can use a Dynamic DNS service to associate a hostname with your IP address.
      This means that even if your IP address changes, the hostname remains the same,
      so you can still access your device remotely by entering the hostname in your browser or other client software.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dynamic DNS is particularly useful for people who want to host servers or other services from their home or office network.
      By using Dynamic DNS, they can give their server or service a hostname that can be accessed from anywhere on the Internet,
      even if the IP address of their network changes frequently.
